        <p class = "no-1">MY NAME IS <strong>NIAZ ALI</strong> and I’m a Designer. I have a passion for simple interfaces. I also love <strong>coding</strong>. Like all French people I live off baguettes, champagne & foie gras evidently! I also say <b>ohlala</b></p>
        <div class = "design">
        <h1 class = "beauty">ohlala</h1>
        </div>
        <p>I’ve always loved solving problems. Being good at science, I graduated and worked as an electronics engineer before teaching myself design. Sometimes I like to write	about what I do in life and at work. I also like to take pictures that tell stories. </p>
        <p>I am currently working at Nutanix as a Designer. If you want, you can view my LinkedIn profile.</p>
        <p>I show designs on Dribbble, and complain about nearly everything on my Twitter account (I’m Pakistani remember). I connect with my family & friends on Facebook. </p>
        <p>Being an avid photographer, I take snapshots with my phone on VSCO and use my big DSLR to put pictures on 500px and videos on Vimeo</p>
        <p>If you have any questions, feedback, or just want to say hello, you can contact me at <a href = "mailto:niazboghri@gmail.com">niazboghri@gmail.com</a></p>
        <P>I traveled a very atypical path, both personally and professionally. I was born in Cameroon and raised in 6 different countries and 3 continents. I speak English, French and Spanish fluently. I have been good at math and science since my childhood, studying and obtaining a Master’s Degree in Electrical Engineering. After working in that field for a couple of years, I decided to learn design on my own and have been working as a product designer and front end developer since July, 2007. </P>
        <P>One of the greatest strenghs about being a designer with an engineer background is that not only I can handle the graphical aspects of a project, but I can also fully understand, participate and even lead the technical aspects of those same projects</P>
